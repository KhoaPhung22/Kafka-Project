# Kafka to MongoDB Pipeline

This project implements a simple data streaming pipeline using Kafka and MongoDB. It reads data from a source Kafka topic, forwards it to a new Kafka topic, and then writes that data to MongoDB.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `kafka_reader.py`: Reads data from a source Kafka topic (`product_view`) and produces it to another topic (`khoa_destination_topic`).
- `kafka_to_mongo.py`: Consumes data from `khoa_destination_topic` and writes it to a MongoDB collection.
